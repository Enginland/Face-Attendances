- Focus on each face and understand that even if a face is turned in a weird direction or in bad lighting, it is still the same person.
- be able to pick out unique features of the face that you can use to tell it apart from other people—like how big the eyes are, how long the face is, etc.
- Finally, compare the unique features of that face to all the people you already know to determine the person’s name.
